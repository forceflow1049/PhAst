-Increased file import speed greatly by reducing number of array resizes for image archive. [Morgan Rehnberg]
-added inital test support for VICAR images. [Morgan Rehnberg]
-wrote new procedure for reading online catalogs to allow for flexibility in catalog choice [Morgan Rehnberg]
-images are now stored as objects.  This fixes the same-size image requirement [Morgan Rehnberg]
-applied image offset to tracking image and mouse clicking.  Resolves object not appearing where it should. [Morgan Rehnberg]
-FITS and VICAR images can now be opened in the same session.  Most features still do not work with VICAR images [Morgan Rehnberg]

11/30/2011 RWC

Zeropoint ack window ("successful") changed to report zeropoint result.

Photometric catalog distinguished from astrometric catalog.
Catalog access routine changed to reference GSC 2.3.2 as GSC-2.3.
We should follow the SCAMP documentation on naming catalogs, which follows Vizier.

phast_calculate_zeropoint rewritten to use regression technique to estimate
zeropoint and color term.  But, we cannot use the new zeropoint in measurements
yet because there is no way to account for the color term

Some miscellaneous changes have been made throughout in the process.

12/10/2011

Changes made to image and calibration areas of batch processing menu to improve
human factors and for training on IDL widget use.  In process, have found that a
sextractor directory variable was being used for the batch processing directory.
I created a state.batch_dirname variable and used it in batch processing code.

12/XX/2011

Modifications to coordinate zeropoint determination with Sextractor KRON photometry.
1. state.sex_PHOT_AUTOPARAMS: [2.5, 0.0] defined and used to pass these values automatically
   to sextractor when it is processing image for zeropoint determination.

2. photometry menus revised to allow user to input color term for use in magnitude
   calculation.  Either by selecting spectral type or by inputting color terms directly.

3. main and photometry windows resized to accommodate added information.
=======
-added update checker.  Help>Check for Updates will now check whether a new version has been released. [Morgan Rehnberg]
-added more robust support for image rotation.  Rotation is now retained when switching between images [Morgan Rehnberg]
-fixed bugs relating to directory loading. Also fixed minor name display bug for all image adds [Morgan Rehnberg]
-improved memory management.  Object pointers should now release memory on object destruction [Morgan Rehnberg]
